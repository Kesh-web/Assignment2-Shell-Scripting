## Project 1: Configuration Scripts
The first project involves creating scripts to automate the initial setup of your system. You'll write a script to install necessary software packages, set up configuration files, and create symbolic links.

## Project 2: New User Script
The second project focuses on creating a user management script. This script will automate the process of adding new users, setting passwords, assigning appropriate groups, and configuring user environments.
